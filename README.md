A tool for "back of the envelope" calculations - from calculating your monthly expenses to modeling Fermi problems. It's spreadsheets without the baggage of spreadsheets.

##Live Demo
[Live Demo](https://dominodes.github.io/dominodes/)

**NOTE:** The demo is a stripped down version of the desktop app. It does not have every feature of the app, and will not work in all browsers.

##Example
Here is an example of an expense calculator using Dominodes:

##FAQ
###How do I use this?
* Create "dominodes" (the labelled cells) by double clicking.
* Hook-up dominodes by first clicking a right-hand "output" dot, then a left-hand "input " dot.
* When trying to connect dominodes, some dominodes will be greyed-out and unselectable. This is to prevent loops from forming.
* Connections can be deleted by repeating the hook-up action.
* Dominodes can be deleted by dropping them onto the trash can icon.
* Variables can be inserted into the formula bar by clicking their icons in the sidebar.
* Click a color at the bottom while a dominode is selected to change its color.
* Save and open Dominodes graphs with the toolbar at the top.

###Where can I get the full desktop app?
