# Dominodes

A tool for "back of the envelope" calculations - from calculating your monthly expenses to modeling Fermi problems. It's spreadsheets without the baggage of spreadsheets.

##Live Demo

Note: The demo is a stripped down version of the desktop app. It does not have every feature of the app, and will not work in all browsers.

##Example
Here is an example of an expense calculator using Dominodes:
